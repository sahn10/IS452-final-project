# IS452-final-project

This project explores the digital humanites through research and code. It contains the following items:

1. An annotated bibliography on digital humanities scholarship: *sahn10_4CR_annotated bib.pdf*
2. A code narrative outlining my process and goals: *sahn10_4CR_code narrative.pdf*
3. A folder with two .py files with my experiments with the Goodreads API and first attempt at my code: *Sahn10 Final Project*
..*After I wrote the loop in *fantasy books.py*, I realized that the length of time it would take to run meant that it made more sense to work in a Jupyter Notebook.
4. The first draft of my code, with explanations (and some errors) in a Jupyter Notebook: *goodreads fantasy books.ipynb*
5. The final draft of my code, with documentaiton (and hopefully no errors...) also a in a Jupyter Notebook: *"diverse" fantasy books on goodreads.ipynb*
